# Unsupervised-Learning-Challenge
The Unsupervised-Learning-Challenge is a project to preprocess data, reduced dimensionality, and perform k-Means clustering on cryptocurrency data to determine whether or not if cryptocurrencies can be grouped into a classification system. 
## Data
* The data can be found in the **Resources folder**: *crypto_data.csv*
## Analysis
* The analysis of the cryptocurrency data can be found in the **Analysis folder**: *crypto_data_preparation_and_analysis.ipynb*
* The python workbook will include: data preparation, dimensionality reduction, and k-Means clustering.
## How to Use
* To ensure that the code runs correctly, run each line from top to bottom.
